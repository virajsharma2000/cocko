cocko language does not have parser.One good thing cocko can work on windows ,linux and mac os.I created cocko language using python. We dont need to type
command to run cocko file and because of cocko all files now are executeable.You dont need to write .cocko we can name it as filename just.It does not have 
any error if we type wrong code of cocko it will fail after that it will not show any thing.It is ment to create string app.
