cocko language does not have parser.One good news twit can work on windows ,linux and mac os.I created twit language using python.We dont need to type
command to run twit file and because of twit all files now are executeable.You dont need to write .cocko we can name it as filename just.It does not have 
any error if we type wrong code of twit it will fail after that it will not show any thing.It is ment to create string app.
